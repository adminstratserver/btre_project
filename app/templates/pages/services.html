          <p>As a SaaS service provider, our system automates trade orders directly into our client's trading plaform. It is no different from outsourcing the monitoring and trade executions based on your choice of a trading algorithm. </p>

  <div class="row text-left">

          <ul>This is a simple 3 steps process as follows:</ul><br><br>

          <ul>1. Client select the trading algorithm file based on his risk-rewards appetite from the large range of algorithm files (OptionNalytics Algo-Library).</ul>
          <ul>2. A dedicated server (OptionNalytics Stratserver) is setup which is loaded with the algo-file, and the server is connected to the client's IB trading PC via internet. Stratserver is given authorisation by client's PC to send trade orders into IB trading platform.</ul>
          <ul>3. When the rule-based algo triggers a trade order and execution, the trade order is sent from Stratserver to the client's trading PC. An alert notification message is also sent to the clients HP.</ul>
